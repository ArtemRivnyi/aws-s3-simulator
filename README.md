## ✨ Overview and Project Goals

The primary goal of the **AWS S3 Simulator** is to provide a **100% S3-compatible local environment** for development and integration testing. By leveraging **MinIO** and **Docker Compose**, the project ensures environment consistency and ease of use.

The project is structured around a single `docker-compose.yml` file and a set of helper **Bash scripts** that manage the full lifecycle of the simulator, from setup to cleanup.

## 🎯 Key Features

| Feature | Description | Demonstrated Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full S3 Compatibility** | Uses MinIO, which is fully compliant with the AWS S3 API. | Ensures application logic tested locally will work seamlessly in production AWS S3. |
| **Isolated Environment** | Runs entirely within a Docker container, keeping the host system clean. | Eliminates dependency conflicts and simplifies setup on any OS. |
| **Pre-loaded Data** | Includes the `minio_data` folder with a pre-configured test bucket and sample files. | Allows immediate testing without manual data upload. |
| **Utility Scripts** | A suite of Bash scripts for setup, status check, testing, and cleanup. | Streamlines the developer workflow and reduces time spent on environment management. |
| **Web Console** | Access to the MinIO Web Console via `http://localhost:9090`. | Provides a visual interface for bucket/object management and debugging. |

## 🔧 Fixes and Improvements

### Fixed Issues:
1.  **Container Name Fixed** in `scripts/common.sh` - changed from `minio-s3-simulator` to `aws-s3-simulator`.
2.  **Error in `health-check.sh` Fixed** - the `PROJECT_ROOT` variable has been added.
3.  **Web UI Port Fixed** in `scripts/test-minio.sh` - changed from 9001 to 9090.
4.  **Credentials Harmonized** - all scripts now use `admin/password123`.

### New Features:
-   **Added `setup-env.sh` script** - quick setup of environment variables for AWS CLI.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project structure is minimal and focused, ensuring all components are easily accessible and organized:

```
aws-s3-simulator/
├── docker-compose.yml   # Defines the MinIO service and ports
├── minio_data/          # Local volume for persistent MinIO data storage
│   └── my-bucket-1761478199/ # Example pre-loaded bucket
├── samples/             # Sample files for testing uploads (e.g., app-log.log, data.csv)
└── scripts/
    ├── common.sh        # Shared functions and configuration (e.g., aws_cmd wrapper)
    ├── setup-env.sh     # Sets up AWS CLI environment variables (new)
    ├── test-minio.sh    # Executes a full S3 API test suite
    ├── health-check.sh  # Checks system health (Docker, container, network, AWS CLI) (new/updated)
    ├── setup-minio.sh   # Starts MinIO, waits for readiness, and configures the test bucket
    └── cleanup-minio.sh # Stops and removes the container
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

You must have the following tools installed on your system:

*   **Docker**
*   **Docker Compose** (v1 or v2)
*   **AWS CLI** (optional, but recommended for using the provided test scripts)

### 1. Launch MinIO

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Configure AWS CLI (required for each new terminal session)

```bash
source scripts/setup-env.sh
```

### 3. Verification

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test-minio.sh

# Check system health
./scripts/health-check.sh

# List buckets
aws s3 ls --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000
```

## 📋 System Access

- **API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:9000`
- **Web Console**: `http://localhost:9090`
- **Login**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password123`

## 🛠️ Utility Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|----------|
| `setup-env.sh` | Sets up AWS CLI environment variables |
| `test-minio.sh` | Comprehensive MinIO testing (health check, bucket operations, file upload) |
| `health-check.sh` | Checks system status (Docker, container, network, AWS CLI) |
| `common.sh` | Shared functions for all scripts |

## ⚙️ Configuration

Credentials and settings are located in the `.env` file:
```env
# MinIO Configuration
MINIO_ROOT_USER=admin
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=password123

# AWS CLI Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=password123
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

**Note**: Credentials can be changed in `.env`, after which the container must be restarted:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

## 💡 Important Notes

- AWS CLI environment variables must be exported for each new terminal session using the command `source scripts/setup-env.sh`.
- MinIO uses custom credentials `admin/password123` (configured in `.env`).
- All data is stored in `./minio_data` and persists between restarts.

## 🧰 Maintenance and Cleanup

### Stopping the Container

To stop and remove the MinIO container (while preserving the data in `minio_data`):

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Full Data Removal

To perform a complete reset and remove all stored data, manually delete the local volume:

```bash
docker-compose down
rm -rf minio_data/
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the container logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
